# HyperVolt - Vesta Energy Orchestrator

**Sustainergy Hackathon 2026 - Team HyperVolt**

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Vesta** is an AI-Driven Energy Orchestrator that doesn't just monitor energy - it predicts, optimizes, and acts as a "Brain" for your home's energy ecosystem. Using Digital Twin technology and Predictive Edge Intelligence, Vesta simulates the future and self-optimizes in real-time.

### The Vision

Most energy systems show you data. **Vesta simulates the future and self-optimizes in real-time.** It predicts a building's energy needs based on:
- External weather patterns
- Occupancy behavior
- Real-time carbon intensity of the power grid
- Time-of-use electricity pricing

### The "Mind-Blowing" Factor

- **Predictive Analytics**: Tells judges not what is happening now, but what will happen
- **Carbon Optimization**: Shifts heavy tasks to hours when the grid uses more renewable energy
- **Orchestrated Sources**: Intelligently switches between Grid/Solar/Battery to minimize cost and carbon
- **Adaptive Lighting**: Auto-adjusts brightness based on ambient light without user noticing
- **Visual Impact**: Sleek 3D Digital Twin dashboard that reacts to real-time sensor data

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+ (for frontend)
- ESP32 development board (for hardware)
- API Keys (optional, see Setup)

### Quick Start - Module 3 (Data Collection)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArYaNsAiNi-here/HyperVolt.git
   cd HyperVolt
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables (optional)**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env to add API keys (or use mock data)
   ```

4. **Collect datasets for AI training**
   ```bash
   cd module3-ai
   python collect_all_data.py
   ```

   This generates:
   - 30 days of weather data
   - 30 days of carbon intensity patterns
   - 30 days of energy consumption
   - 30 days of sensor readings
   - Integrated ML-ready dataset

5. **Review collected data**
   ```bash
   ls -lh ../data/raw/
   # You'll see: weather_historical.csv, carbon_historical.csv, 
   # energy_consumption.csv, sensor_readings.csv, integrated_dataset.csv
   ```

## 📊 Key Features

### AI-Powered Optimization

```python
# The AI decides:
if carbon_intensity > threshold and battery_available:
    switch_to_battery()
elif solar_available and time_is_day:
    use_solar()
else:
    use_grid()
```

### Adaptive Lighting Logic

```
LDR senses: 400 lux (bright room)
AI predicts: User won't notice 20% dimming
Action: Dim lights, save 40W
Result: Invisible to user, 0.96 kWh saved daily
```

### Carbon Intelligence

```
Grid Carbon: 650 gCO2eq/kWh (high - coal plants running)
AI Decision: Delay EV charging to 2 AM when solar comes online
